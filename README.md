# A Point Of Sale System
Math'am Almufid is a restaurant that provides a variety of Arabic cuisine. We provide a system that can be used as a cashier by simply entering a code per meal. Each menu has its own code. First, a list of menus will appear and the user will input the code and enter the quantity. After that, the system will print the latest order and will ask whether he/she wants to add an order or not. If yes, then the user will return to the menu options. Otherwise, the user will be redirected to the purchase receipt which contains the menu name, price, quantity, number of items, and subtotals. Then the user is asked to enter the discount and the system will calculate the final total payment together with the tax.
